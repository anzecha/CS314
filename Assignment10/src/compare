AUSTIN TO MULESHOE

Dijkstra
start Dijkstra
end Dijkstra, nodes = 71
Road Distance austin to muleshoe = 452
Route to muleshoe = (austin lampasas brownwood abilene roscoe snyder lubbock muleshoe)

A*
start A* dist
end A*, nodes = 11
Road Distance austin to muleshoe = 452
Route to muleshoe = (austin lampasas brownwood abilene roscoe snyder lubbock muleshoe)

start A* halfass
end A*, nodes = 40
Road Distance austin to muleshoe = 452
Route to muleshoe = (austin lampasas brownwood abilene roscoe snyder lubbock muleshoe)

start A* zip
end A*, nodes = 65
Road Distance austin to muleshoe = 452
Route to muleshoe = (austin lampasas brownwood abilene roscoe snyder lubbock muleshoe)

start A* randombs
end A*, nodes = 65
Road Distance austin to muleshoe = 452
Route to muleshoe = (austin lampasas brownwood abilene roscoe snyder lubbock muleshoe)

start A* randomlies
end A*, nodes = 54
Road Distance austin to muleshoe = 649
Route to muleshoe = (austin lampasas brownwood abilene roscoe snyder lubbock muleshoe)


Prim
start Prim
end Prim, total cost = 3598
edgecost austin to temple = 62
Route Austin to Muleshoe = (austin lampasas brownwood abilene roscoe big-spring lamesa lubbock muleshoe)
pathcost austin to muleshoe = 501
Total cost of all roads = 8061

So Dijkstra had the most number of visited nodes while A* with the dist heuristic method had the least while they
still had the same distance
A* and Dijkstra both found the least expensive path while Prim had the most expensive
