2. Can you think of an invariant (property that is always true) of peanoplus? What is the Big O of peanoplus?

In peanoplus an invariant was that x and y add up to a constant  that does not change with each iteration.

The Big O was O(n)

3. What is the Big O of peanotimes?

The Big O is O(n^2)

8. Use the function (choose n k) that you wrote earlier to calculate (choose 4 k) for k from 0 through 4; what is the relationship between these values and the binomial coefficients?

The binomial coefficients are the same as those to n choose k. In the choose function n determines the row while k is the column starting from 0 from the left.
